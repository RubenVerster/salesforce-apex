## Anatomy of a Class

A class is a user-defined datatype and acts as blueprint for their instances

A Class Definition consists of State, Memeber Variables and Behavior, Member Functions as well as a Constructor to initialize the state of the class.

When a class is private it cannot be accessed outside the class. So Class1 does not have access to the State and Behaviors of Class2. Only State and Behaviour can be accessed within the class

If a class is public, and it's functions or variables are also public, it can be accessed outside the class, by other classes as well. So Class1 can access data in Class2, and vice versa.

If a class is global, it can be accessed from anywhere, even outside the package.

## Class In Action

An Object is an instance of a class, Class In Action

```
class Class1 {
    Integer num1;
    Integer num2;

    public addNumbers() {
        System.debug(num1 + num2);
    }
}

MyClass mc1 = new Class1()
```

Here 'mc1' would have access to the State and Behaviors of Class1. So 'num1' and 'num2' would be accessible as well as the 'addNumbers' function.

## Methods

Methods are reusable code snippets that serve a specific purpose.
They accept input and return output.

```
public class Demo1 {
    public void printOutput(String displayString) {
        System.debug('Display Text: ' + displayString);
    }
}

//now to use it
//You define the type of the object you want to create, the name of it and the constructor
Demo1 d1 = new Demo1();
d1.printOutput('Hello World');

```

## Static VS Instance

A static initializer block is executed only once, when the class is loaded.

## Extending A Class

Use the 'virtual' keyword

Mark the method and the class as virtual

Extending the class can override and provide a new definition to the virtual method.

## Interface

An interface is a contract that enforces what a child must do

Interfaces contain method declarations, not method definitions

Interfaces cannot be instantiated on their owm

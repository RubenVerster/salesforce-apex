# Triggers

A Trigger is a procedure in a database which automatically invokes whenever a special even in the DB occurs

Triggers enable you to perform custom acrions before or after events to records in Salesforce, such as insertions, updates or deletions

A good example would be for creating logs of your app's activity

## Variables

---

```
trigger TriggerName on ObjectName (trigger_events) {
    //code block
}

trigger myAccountTrigger on Account (before insert, before update) {
    //code block
}
```

## Order Of Execution

This is what a general flow of executions would look like for a trigger

### These two would run in conjunction.

This one will then be run since the above one triggered it

## Best Practices

### Bad Practice

This would select the first record in a List every time. Bad code for when you insert multiple records
<img src="../0%20-%20Resources/triggers-bad-practice.jpeg">
You can run a for loop to find the correct record, but this can overflow the stack and exceed the call limit

## Recursion

This would break, via infinite loop, because the block is already in an update trigger, but you update the list after everything, causing the trigger to run again

---

## How To Avoid Recursion

This checks if the record is being inserted or updated, and if it is, it will not run the trigger

## When To Use Triggers

When complex logic is incapable of being processed via declaritive artifacts

Logic is associated with DML

Operations on unrelated objects

Integration with External Systems

```
trigger TotalPrice on Invoice_Line_Item__c (after insert) {

    if(Trigger.isAfter && Trigger.isInsert){
        Set <Id> inVoiceSet = new Set<Id>();
        Map <Id,Invoice__c> invoicesToBeUpdated = new Map <Id,Invoice__c>();
        for(Invoice_Line_Item__c c: Trigger.new){
            inVoiceSet.add(c.Invoice_Lookup);
        }
        Map<Id, Invoice__c> invoiceMap = new Map<Id, Invoice__c>([SELECT Id,Name,Total_Price__c FROM Invoice__c WHERE Id IN :inVoiceSet]);


        for(Invoice_Line_Item__c c : Trigger.new){
            if(!invoicesToBeUpdated.containsKey(c.Invoice_Lookup)){
                Invoice__c a = invoiceMap.get(c.Invoice_Lookup);
                a.Total_Price__c = a.Total_Price__c + c.price__c;
                invoicesToBeUpdated.put(a.id, a);
            }
            else {
                Invoice__c a = invoicesToBeUpdated.get(c.Invoice_Lookup);
                a.Total_Price__c = a.Total_Price__c + c.price__c;
                invoicesToBeUpdated.put(a.id, a);
            }
        }
        List <Invoice__c> invoicesToBeUpdatedList = new List<Invoice__c>();
        for(Id invoiceId : invoicesToBeUpdated.keySet()){
            invoicesToBeUpdatedList.add(invoicesToBeUpdated.get(invoiceId));
        }
        if(invoicesToBeUpdatedList.size()>0)
            update invoicesToBeUpdated;
    }
}
```

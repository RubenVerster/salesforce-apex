Similar to SQL, but designed for querying data from Salesforce.
Uses same structure and keywords from SQL

## Clauses

```
SELECT StageName, COUNT(Id) FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = LAST_YEAR GROUP BY StageName HAVING COUNT(Id) > 1
```

```
StageName               | count(Id)
Prospecting             | 3

## Writing SOQL In APEX

```
List<Opportunity> lstOpp = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Opportunity];
System.debug(lstOpp);
```

```
List<Opportunity> lstOpp = [SELECT Name, Account.Name, Account.Type FROM Opportunity];
for (Opportunity opp : lstOpp) {
    System.debug(`Opp Name - ` + opp.Name)
    System.debug(`Parent Account - ` + opp.Account.Name)
}
```

## DML Operations

Insert example

<img src="../0%20-%20Resources/dml-example.jpeg"/>

Update example

```
Opportunity opp = [SELECT Id FROM Opportunity WHERE Name = 'New Opportunity ApexHours 0213'];
opp.Amount = 5000;
update opp;
```

Delete example

```
Opportunity opp = [SELECT Id FROM Opportunity WHERE Name = 'New Opportunity ApexHours 0213'];
delete opp;
```

---

## Database Methods

<img src="../0%20-%20Resources/database-methods.jpeg"/>

Insert multiple example

<img src="../0%20-%20Resources/dml-example-2.jpeg"/>

```
//then insert the set into the DB
Database.insert(lstOpp, false);
```

The second paramater is to tell the DB call to follow atomicity or not

To see the results of the DB query

```
Databse.SaveResult[] sr = Database.insert(lstOpp, false);

for (Database.SaveResult var : sr) {
    System.debug('Result - ' + var.isSuccess());
}
```

## Transaction Control Interface

Here is an example of a query that will fail because of field validation. A field is missing a value.

<img src="../0%20-%20Resources/query-rollback.jpeg"/>

The query will successfully insert the Account, but will fail at the Contact. All the data will then be rolled back, and the Account will not be inserted. Rolling your DB state back to before this block of code was executed

You can create a save point of your database to keep the state of your DB in memory

```
System.Savepoint spt = Database.setSavepoint();
```

Alternatively, you can use a rollback method to roll your DB back to the savepoint you created

```
Database.rollback(spt);
```
